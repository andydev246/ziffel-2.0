Sometimes as a kid, having a view that others actively disagreed with made me feel unlovable. Thus, I learned to harshly critique my own thoughts and feelings and to repress them if I think others will not like them. And this carried over into adulthood. So now I try to remind myself that this kind of thinking was once useful for feeling safe, but isn’t necessary anymore.  does that sound at all familiar?",
