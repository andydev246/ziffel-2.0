# üß† From Conversations to Validation:
### A Dynamic FSM Framework for Testing Emotional Intelligence in AI

**By Andres de Vivanco**

---

## üéØ The Problem

Modern LLMs can generate coherent text ‚Äî but can they show **empathy**?

Can they detect when someone is burned out or lost? Can they follow up with the right **pivot question** ‚Äî one that nudges the user toward clarity?

This is more than NLP. This is about testing **emotional intelligence**.

As an SDET, I wanted a system that doesn't just test grammar or syntax, but can assess whether an AI:
- Understands user **tone**
- Responds with **appropriate empathy**
- Follows up with the right **pivot questions**

## üõ†Ô∏è Enter: Ziffel 2.0

**Ziffel 2.0** is a dynamic framework that:
- Scrapes emotional Reddit threads
- Classifies user turns semantically using **local Sentence Transformers**
- Extracts **intents**, **orientations**, **tones**, and **pivot questions**
- Builds and **walks a Finite State Machine (FSM)** in real-time
- Validates every AI response against a structured **Oracle**

---

## üß± Architecture Overview


---

### 1. üßµ Reddit Thread Fetching

Given only the name of a subreddit (`r/DecidingToBeBetter`), we use:

- **`RedditMarkdownFetcher`** ‚Äì Downloads conversation threads
- **`MarkdownParser`** ‚Äì Parses these into structured dialog turns between a user and a "therapist" or responder.

---

### 2. üß† Intent Detection via Local Embeddings

No OpenAI used here. We use **Sentence Transformers** (via HuggingFace) locally to embed each utterance, then:

- Reduce embeddings via **UMAP**
- Cluster them with **KMeans or DBSCAN**
- Assign inferred **intent IDs** per cluster (e.g. `user.burnout`, `user.fear`)

This allows us to build the FSM semantically ‚Äî **no pre-labeled data needed**.

---

### 3. üé≠ Orientation, Tone & Pivot Extraction

Each turn is classified by:
- **Orientation:** `practical`, `emotional`, `spiritual`, `mixed`
- **Tone:** `empathetic`, `encouraging`, `reflective`, etc.
- **Pivot Question:** Identified by looking for question marks and analyzing context.

### 4. üîÑ FSM & Oracle Generation

The FSM represents conversation flow. The Oracle defines what we expect.

Here‚Äôs a **complex FSM** dynamically generated from Reddit:

### ‚úÖ FSM Example: Multi-Path Emotional Branching

```json
{
  "startState": "Neutral",
  "states": {
    "Neutral": {
      "transitions": {
        "t0": {
          "prompt": "I just feel stuck, like I‚Äôm not making progress in life.",
          "intent": "user.stuck",
          "orientation": "mixed",
          "expectedContains": "That can be tough to deal with",
          "expectedTone": "empathetic",
          "expectedPivot": "what's holding you back?",
          "next": ["ExploreFear", "SeekMotivation", "DiscussRoutine"]
        }
      }
    },
    "ExploreFear": {
      "transitions": {
        "t1": {
          "prompt": "I think I‚Äôm afraid of failing again.",
          "intent": "user.fear",
          "orientation": "emotional",
          "expectedContains": "Fear of failure is very common",
          "expectedTone": "reassuring",
          "expectedPivot": "where do you think that fear comes from?",
          "next": "Exit"
        }
      }
    },
    "SeekMotivation": {
      "transitions": {
        "t2": {
          "prompt": "I just need something to get me moving.",
          "intent": "user.unmotivated",
          "orientation": "action-oriented",
          "expectedContains": "Let's try identifying small wins",
          "expectedTone": "encouraging",
          "expectedPivot": "what‚Äôs one thing you could do today?",
          "next": "Exit"
        }
      }
    },
    "DiscussRoutine": {
      "transitions": {
        "t3": {
          "prompt": "My days feel chaotic. I need more structure.",
          "intent": "user.needsStructure",
          "orientation": "practical",
          "expectedContains": "Structure can really help with consistency",
          "expectedTone": "practical",
          "expectedPivot": "have you tried scheduling small habits?",
          "next": "Exit"
        }
      }
    },
    "Exit": {
      "transitions": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### üß™ Oracle (Validation Layer)

```json
{
  "Neutral": {
    "t0": {
      "expectedContains": "That can be tough to deal with",
      "expectedTone": "empathetic",
      "expectedPivot": "what's holding you back?"
    }
  },
  "ExploreFear": {
    "t1": {
      "expectedContains": "Fear of failure is very common",
      "expectedTone": "reassuring",
      "expectedPivot": "where do you think that fear comes from?"
    }
  },
  "SeekMotivation": {
    "t2": {
      "expectedContains": "Let's try identifying small wins",
      "expectedTone": "encouraging",
      "expectedPivot": "what‚Äôs one thing you could do today?"
    }
  },
  "DiscussRoutine": {
    "t3": {
      "expectedContains": "Structure can really help with consistency",
      "expectedTone": "practical",
      "expectedPivot": "have you tried scheduling small habits?"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5 üß™ How We Validate

Every step of the FSM is tested in real time:
- Prompt is sent to OpenAI or another LLM
- Response is checked for:
  - `expectedContains`
  - `expectedTone` (via lightweight sentiment model)
  - `expectedPivot` (string matching or fuzzy matching)
- If correct ‚Üí walk to next state
- If incorrect ‚Üí fail and log

### 6 üîÅ Progressive Execution

The tool expands the FSM and Oracle dynamically:
1. Start with first N dialog turns from Reddit
2. Build FSM + Oracle
3. Run test runner to validate
4. Continue reading next N turns
5. Expand FSM and Oracle
6. Resume walk from last known state

This makes it capable of running against entire threads over time ‚Äî like an infinite test crawl of emotional intelligence.

### 7. Why This Matters

‚úÖ No human labeling required

‚úÖ Fully dynamic and evolving

‚úÖ Tests tone, empathy, and conversation flow

‚úÖ Uses real human data

‚úÖ Independent of the LLM being tested

---

### üß¨ Origins

Ziffel 2.0 is inspired by Ziffel, the model-based testing framework I wrote during my internship at Microsoft in 2000, under the mentorship of Harry Robinson.

This new version takes that legacy forward ‚Äî into the realm of AI and human emotions.

### üöÄ What‚Äôs Next

I'm preparing to release the tool as open source. If you care about AI alignment, emotional UX, or human-centered QA, I'd love to collaborate.
